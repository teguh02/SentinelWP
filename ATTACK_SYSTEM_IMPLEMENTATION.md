## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Attack Detection Workflow:
1. **Event Monitoring**: WordPress hooks capture security events
2. **Threshold Analysis**: Events analyzed against configurable thresholds
3. **Attack Classification**: Events classified by type and severity
4. **Database Logging**: All events stored with metadata
5. **Notification Dispatch**: Multi-channel alerts based on severity
6. **Response Actions**: Automatic quarantine for file-based attacks

### Security Features:
- **IP Intelligence**: Advanced IP detection with proxy support
- **File Quarantine**: Suspicious files automatically isolated
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable thresholds for different attack types
- **Data Sanitization**: All inputs properly escaped and validated
- **Permission Checks**: WordPress capability verification
- **Nonce Protection**: CSRF protection on all AJAX actions

### Notification Channels:
1. **Email**: HTML-formatted with attack details and recommendations
2. **Telegram**: Real-time bot notifications with emojis and formatting
3. **Admin Dashboard**: In-app notifications and status banners  
4. **Log Files**: Persistent daily logs for forensics
5. **WordPress Admin Notices**: Critical alert integration
